#### Tutorials

This project will be used for keeping together all work I do as I start coing to 
terms with text analysis. The main notebook I will be using is 
[the textbook written by Silge and Robinson](https://www.tidytextmining.com/preface.html).

```{R}
# Install the necessary libraries

install.packages("tidytext")
install.packages("broom")

```
